    <title>To THE Kevin PHillips</title>

    OH how you've made it thus far. What an amazing journey, I must say, what an incredible person you are. To changing the haters, to your legacy's narrators. To giving your friends, no dead ends. To leaving them with passion and fire, but, that's not what their heart desires. To making it big with your brother, and to making it big for your mother. This poem is to you, written by yourself, a gift to your inevitable future, no failure and all success.
